# ENISA Space Threat Landscape Dataset and Dashboard

This repository provides the dataset and an accompanying interactive dashboard used in the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) Space Threat Landscape report. These resources are designed to assist cybersecurity experts in the commercial space sector in identifying and mitigating potential threats.

## Dataset

The dataset is provided in an Excel format (`ENISA_Space_Threat_Dataset.xlsx`) and expands upon the control appendix of the ENISA report. It offers three distinct views:

* **Control View:** Detailed information about each security control.
* **Threat View:** Mapping of controls to specific threat categories.
* **Lifecycle View:** Alignment of controls with phases of the satellite lifecycle.

This detailed breakdown allows users to analyze and understand the relationships between controls, threats, and the satellite lifecycle, enabling more informed security decisions.

## Dashboard

To facilitate analysis and provide actionable recommendations, an interactive Microsoft PowerBi dashboard is included. This visualization tool leverages a comprehensive analysis of **281 controls** from **13 prominent cybersecurity frameworks**.

Key features of the dashboard include:

* Visualization of control mappings to the satellite lifecycle phases.
* Filtering and search capabilities to quickly identify relevant controls.
* Interactive charts and graphs for data exploration.
* Clear and actionable recommendations based on the analysis.

The dashboard is designed to help experts:

* Identify critical controls for each phase of the satellite lifecycle.
* Understand the coverage of existing frameworks against identified threats.
* Identify security measures based on risk/threat and relevance.

## Usage

1.  **Download the Dataset:** Download `Control Framework.xlsx` to your local machine.
2.  **Download the Dashboard:** Download `Control Framework.pbix` to your local machine.
3.  **Open the Dashboard:** Open `Control Framework.pbix` using Microsoft's PowerBI application (either the free Power BI Desktop or the Power BI Services)
4.  **Explore and Analyze:** Use the dashboard's features to explore the data, filter controls, and generate reports.
5.  **Reference the ENISA Report:** For context and background information, refer to the official ENISA Space Threat Landscape report.

You can update/change the dataset and refresh the dashboard to show the changes. Either create the folder C:\Space and store the xlsx file there or through PowerBI 'Data source settings' assign a new location for the dataset
